## ðŸ‘‹ About Me

Hello! I'm Abdallah Qasim, a college student passionate about technology, software development, and database management. Iâ€™m actively exploring new tools and techniques that deepen my understanding of both coding and data structures. Currently, Iâ€™m diving into courses like **Project Management Foundations** and **Public Speaking**, both of which are sharpening my technical and communication skills for a future in tech.

### ðŸ’» Technical Skills & Interests
I enjoy working on projects that challenge me to learn and grow. My main focus areas include:
- **Programming Languages**: Python, SQL, HTML/CSS
- **Database Management**: Designing and managing databases in ACEIT/MySQL
- **Version Control**: Practicing Git and enhancing my GitHub profile to manage project revisions effectively

Beyond coding, Iâ€™m constantly motivated to level up my profile and skills. I recently completed a **LinkedIn Learning Markdown** certificate to make my GitHub profile stand out and convey information clearly to others.

### ðŸŒ± Personal Interests & Goals
Outside of tech, I love **gaming** and **reading**, which help me recharge and find inspiration for new projects. I aim to build a strong foundation in software development and backend technologies, with a long-term goal of contributing to impactful tech solutions. Iâ€™m particularly interested in building efficient, scalable applications that can solve real-world challenges.

Iâ€™m always open to new projects and collaboration opportunities, so feel free to [connect on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abdullah-qasem-73b338215/) or check out my latest projects here on GitHub!
